# MACRO_INDICATOR SIGNAL BUILDER
This project aims to analyze and explore how macroeconomic indicators can be translated into investment signals across major asset classes specifically focusing on stocks, bonds, and currencies.

KEY IDEAS:
- understand how the economy is performing by looking at macro indicators
- translate these conditions into investment insights
- test whether these insights would have worked historically

MACROECNOMIC INDICATORS USED
- GDP growth: overall economic impact
- inflation: price levels in the economy
- unemployment rate: labor market strength
- interest rate: monetary policy stance

ASSET CLASSES USED
- stocks (SPY, QQQ)
- bonds (HYG, TLT)
- dollar (UUP)
- commodities (GLD)

Goal: generate buy/sell signals for these asset classes based on macro conditions

INVESTMENT LOGIC
- if gdp growth is negative and inflation is falling => buy bonds
    (suggests a weakening economy and less inflation pressure, so bonds benefit)
- if unemployment is dropping and gdp is rising => buy equities
    (strong labor market + growth usually mean good earnings and stock returns)
- if interest rates are rising => buy the dollar
    (higher rates attract global capital to the USD)
