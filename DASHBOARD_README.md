## üîß API Endpoints

The dashboard provides several REST API endpoints:

- `GET /` - Main dashboard page
- `GET /api/current_data` - Current macro data and signals
- `GET /api/historical_data` - Historical time series data
- `GET /api/performance_metrics` - Performance by economic regime
- `GET /api/regime_analysis` - Economic regime transitions

## üìä Data Sources

The dashboard uses the following macroeconomic indicators:
- **GDP Growth**: Overall economic performance
- **Inflation (CPI)**: Price level changes
- **Unemployment Rate**: Labor market strength
- **Fed Funds Rate**: Monetary policy stance

## üéØ Investment Logic

### Signal Generation Rules

#### Macro Indicators
1. **GDP Growth Signal**
   - GDP > 2.5% + Unemployment < 5% ‚Üí BUY (stocks)
   - GDP < 0% ‚Üí BUY (bonds)
   - Otherwise ‚Üí HOLD

2. **Inflation Signal**
   - Inflation > 4% ‚Üí SELL (bonds)
   - Inflation < 1% ‚Üí BUY (bonds)
   - Otherwise ‚Üí HOLD

3. **Interest Rate Signal**
   - Fed Funds > 4% ‚Üí BUY (dollar)
   - Otherwise ‚Üí HOLD

4. **Unemployment Signal**
   - Unemployment < 4% ‚Üí BUY (stocks)
   - Unemployment > 8% ‚Üí SELL (stocks)
   - Otherwise ‚Üí HOLD

#### Asset-Specific Scoring
Each asset class uses a scoring system based on macro conditions:

**SPY (Stocks)**: +1 point each for GDP > 2%, Unemployment < 5%, Inflation < 3%, Fed Funds < 3%
- Score ‚â• 3: BUY
- Score ‚â§ 1: SELL
- Otherwise: HOLD

**TLT (Bonds)**: +1 point each for GDP < 1%, Inflation < 2%, Fed Funds < 2%
- Score ‚â• 2: BUY
- Score ‚â§ 0: SELL
- Otherwise: HOLD

**GLD (Gold)**: +1 point each for Inflation > 3%, Fed Funds < 1%, GDP < 1%
- Score ‚â• 2: BUY
- Score ‚â§ 0: SELL
- Otherwise: HOLD

**UUP (Dollar)**: +1 point each for Fed Funds > 3%, GDP > 2%
- Score ‚â• 1: BUY
- Otherwise: HOLD

## üé® Customization
